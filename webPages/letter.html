				Hello, baby! I've been more broke than usual recently and have not been able to buy you gifts, so I spent my time and energy on making you something digital instead! This is my gift to you for our 6 month mark! I know we send a lot of voice memos to each other, but they can get lost, so I made a small catalog of all of your "I love you"s so far! Click the avocado, and enjoy!
